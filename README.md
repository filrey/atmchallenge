# Ant Money Coding Challenge

Build a standalone frontend app using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) that allows users to input an IP address. You can retrieve the country & city from GeoJS and show them on the page. The page should show all the input IP addresses and the country & city associated with them.

# Instructions

The application will automatically display your current IP, Country, and City if applicable. New searches will update the display and be saved in the table. Compatible with
IPv6 and IPv4 addresses.

> Thank you and hope you like the application! **-Filiberto**
